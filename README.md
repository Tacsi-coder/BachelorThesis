Remind Me is an Android App, created using the Android Studio IDE. It is basically a Reminder App which asks for the 
content of the Reminder that the user wants to put up, whether the user wants the notification  to repeat(update) after
a certain time or not and also how long the user wants the Reminder to stay in their notifications. On clicking the
"Set Reminder" button, the reminder is set as a notification and appears in the notification panel along with the time
at which the reminder is to be updated next(if given by user) and the deadline for the reminder.

Multiple Reminders can be set using the app at a time and can be viewed in the notification panel. The notifications have
been given a high priority so that they will always appear on top of all notifications and also appear if the phone is 
locked.  

To Delete the reminder all you have to do is just swipe right/left to remove the notification.
